Hi there. I'm Sebastián Alcántara, a chemical engineer with a love for coding, game design, gaming, scientific skepticism and maybe some exercise.

Very happily married, father of one awesome kid and with another one in the way.

In this blog I will share little bits of info that I find to be interesting about any of this topics.

This blog is made with Jekyll and GitHub Pages:

I'm using the Minima theme for this blog. You can find the source code for Minima at GitHub:
