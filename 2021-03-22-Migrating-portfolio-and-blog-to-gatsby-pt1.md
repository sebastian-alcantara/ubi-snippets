Hi there! I have been ausent for a while now.

At the beginning of 2020, when the Covid-19's pandemic started unfolding, we had our beautiful daughter.
As many people, our family (wife, boy and girl) spent a lot of time together.
Our kid with remote schooling, and the adults taking kare of our baby while working also remotelly.

Today I decided to rebuild my site almost from scratch.

Its present iteration was built in vanilla JavaScript (the portfolio bit), while the blog was built with Jekyll.

Since I like React quite a bit, and I have created a simple project with GatsbyJS recently, decided to rebuild my personal site using it.

This is not a mamooth migration in any way, but I thought it would be nice to write about the process and some differences I might find.

For example, excerpts.
Syntax highlightning.
