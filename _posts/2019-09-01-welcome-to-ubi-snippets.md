Hi there! This is the first entry of my blog.

I would like to use this space to share information that I find to be interesting about things I love: `coding`, `web developement`, `game design`, `training` (maybe?) and `scientific skepticism`.

To keep focus, I will start with coding.

For the second entry of this blog, I'm working in a little code snippet that explains how to make AJAX get requests with plain JavaScript to a Django server (no jQuery).

Cheers, have a good one!
